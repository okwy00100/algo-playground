     * Description of the problem
     * --------------------------
     * There's a round robin tournament in which there can only be one winner and loser and no ties.
     * If they wins, they get 3 points, 0 points if they lose. Given an array of pairs representing the teams that compete and
     * an array containing the results of each competition, write a function that returns the winner of the tournament.
     * The input arrays are "competitions" and "results" respectively. The competitions array has elements [hometeam, awayteam],
     * where each team is a string of at most 30 characters representing the name of the team.
     * The "results" array contains information about the winner of each corresponding competition in the "competitions" array.
     * Specifically, "results[i]" denotes the winner of "competition[i]" where 1 means home won, and 0 means away won.
     *
     * It is guaranteed the tournament will always have at least two teams and also exactly one team will compete against all other
     * teams exactly once meaning a winner of the tournament is guaranteed as well.
