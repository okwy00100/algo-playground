     * Description of the problem
     * --------------------------
     * Given an integer *start* and a list *edges* of pairs of integers
     *
     * The list is what's called an adjacency list and it represents a graph. The number of vertices in the graph is equal to the length
     * of *edges*, where each index *i* in *edges* contains vertex *i*'s outbound edges, in no particular order. Each individual edge is
     * represented by a pair of two numbers, [*destination*, *distance*], where the destination is a positive integer denoting the destination
     * vertex and the distance is a positive integer representing the length of the edge (the distance from vertex *i* to vertex *destination*).
     * Note that these edges are directed, meaning that you can only travel from a particular vertex to its destination nary the opposite
     *
     * Write a function that calculates the lengths of the shortest paths between *start* and all the other vertices withing the graph using
     * the famous Dijkstra's Algorithm, returning them in an array. Each index *i* in the output array should represent the length of the
     * shortest path between *start* and the vertex *i*. If no path is found from *start* to vertex *i*, then output[i] should be -1
     *
     * Important to note that the graph represented by edges won't contain any self-loops (vertices that have outbound edge to themselves)
     * and will only have positively weighted edges (ie. no negative distances)
     *
